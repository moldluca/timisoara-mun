            <h4 id="terms-disputes">14. Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p><strong>14.1 Internal Resolution.</strong> Disputes should first be resolved through direct discussion, mediation by Organizer representatives, and consultation with committee chairs.</p>
            <p><strong>14.2 Jurisdiction.</strong> Unresolved disputes fall under Romanian courts, applying Romanian law.</p>
            <p><strong>14.3 Applicable Law.</strong> Romanian Civil Code, laws on associations and foundations, GDPR, and other relevant regulations apply.</p>
            <p><strong>14.4 Alternatives.</strong> Parties may agree to arbitration, mediation, conciliation, or other mutually accepted ADR methods.</p>
            <p><strong>14.5 Deadlines.</strong> Complaints may be filed during the event; post-event complaints must be submitted within 30 days. Refund requests follow section 4.4 deadlines.</p>

            <h4 id="terms-final">15. Final Provisions</h4>
            <p><strong>15.1 Modification.</strong> Organizer may revise these Terms with at least 15 days’ notice for major changes and will publish updates on official channels.</p>
            <p><strong>15.2 Validity.</strong> If a clause is deemed invalid, remaining provisions stay in effect and the Parties will agree on an equivalent valid clause.</p>
            <p><strong>15.3 Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, together with the Application Form, Organizational Regulations, declarations, and related policies constitute the entire agreement.</p>
            <p><strong>15.4 Communications.</strong> Official communications are made via the participant’s registered email, the official website, designated platforms, and announcements during the event.</p>
            <p><strong>15.5 Language.</strong> The Romanian version prevails. Translations are for information only and interpretations follow Romanian legal standards.</p>
            <p><strong>15.6 Entry into Force.</strong> These Terms enter into force upon participant signature and remain valid until all mutual obligations are fulfilled.</p>
            <p><strong>15.7 Notifications and Updates.</strong> Participants must monitor official updates; failure to do so does not remove responsibilities.</p>
            <p><strong>15.8 Compliance with Romanian Legislation.</strong> Participants must comply with Romanian laws throughout their stay. The Organizer cooperates with authorities when required. International participants must meet immigration requirements.</p>
